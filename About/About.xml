	<description>--> SHADOW IS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS MEGAPATCH: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2139417581]SEE HERE[/url]

This is a reupload of their original megapatch with permission, including fixes to some incompatibilities found in the Vanilla Expanded set of mods (bugfixes for Medieval, Brewing Coffee/Tea). More importantly, this is now on GitHub, so *when* there are minor changes necessary in the future, a PR can be submitted and this megapatch updated far more easily by interested parties.

If you wish to contribute, please(!) submit a PR here: [url=https://github.com/dzfischer/SeedsPleaseMegaPatchProject]SeedsPleaseMegaPatchProject Repository[/url].
